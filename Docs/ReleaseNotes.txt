Game Designed by 
Matej Smid and Sofia Fedotova
“Aquarium”
Paris, 2022

We are ready invite you to immerse yourself in the world of The Beatles and explore our aquarium on a Yellow Submarine.
***************************************************************************
How to play?
    Use WASD keyboard buttons to manipulate the submarine.(A - to make it move left, D - to make it move right, W - to move forward)
    The depth of the submarine can be changed using RF buttons (R - to move up, F - to move down)
    Press Esc in order to set a Pause and Change Settings (Not implemented) or to Quit the Game.

Objects of the game
    Fishes:
        The fish swarm is modeled using a boids model. Every fish has a rigidbody component and we are using a PI controller to apply forces and torques on the rigid body to move the fish. The fish need a FishSettings object to get their swiming parameters from. This settings object is only accessible from the editor, not from the build version. For example, we can change the swarm search distance, meaning the fish create bigger swarms. 
    Aquarium: 
        Is generated automatically using modified MeshGenerator script written during the Practical Work. It is made using prefab components that are resized at startup to the set sizes. The script AquariumAssembler.cs assembles the prefabs and also spawns the fish and the trees.
    Sand: 
        Sand generation is implemented by using Perlin Noise to generate a mesh. After a shader is applied to animate the sediment moving in time.
    Water: 
        Plane mesh with a shader for animation.
    Trees: 
        Trees are generated fully automatically using Lsystens theory using a script we took from the unity forums (https://forum.unity.com/threads/l-systems-for-unity-free-script-included.272416/) and modified for our use.
    Submarine: 
        The character of the game – can be manipulated by WASD RF, have a light on it, no special math required.

Notes and Bugs to be fixed
    *The sand and the surface are animated by shaders so the solid part ob the surfaces and the part that can be seen aren't matching as a results
    the submarine can basicaly sink into the sand and and can't reach the surface of the water
    *Trees are generated automatically using scpipt and sometimes they are being generated above the surface
    *In this version submarine and fish just pass through trees not considering them as a solid objects
    *The menu canvas background is not fitted to the resolution of the user display
