Objects of the game
    Fishes:
    Aquarium: Is generated automatically using modified MeshGenerator script written during the Practical Work 
    Sand: Sand generation is implemented by using a PerlinNoise theory im a mesh creation and also the shager is apllied in order to animate it
    Water: Plane mesh with a shader for animation
    Trees: Trees are generated fully automatically using Lsystens theory with a taken from the internet amd modified script

    LS-systems script used to generate trees are taken from the free forum:

Notes and Bugs to be fixed
    *The sand and the surface are animated by shaders so the solid part ob the surfaces and the part that can be seen aren't matching as a result
    the submarine can basicaly sink into the sand and and can't reach the surface of the water
    *Trees are generated automatically using scpipt and sometimes they are being generated above the surface
    *In this version submarine and fish just pass through trees not considering them as a solid objects
